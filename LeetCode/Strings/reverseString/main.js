/* 
reverseWords()
Write a function reverse_words() that takes a message as a list
of characters and reverses the order of the words in place. â†´

O(n) time and O(1)O(1) space!

The naive solution of reversing the words one at a time had a worst-case O(n^2)
runtime. That's because swapping words with different lengths required "scooting over" all the other characters to make room.

To get around this "scooting over" issue, we reversed all the characters in the message first. This put all the words 
in the correct spots, but with the characters in each word backward. So to get the final 
answer, we reversed the characters in each word. This all takes two passes through the 
message, so O(n)time total.
